## 2026-06-19 — Claude: collaboration scaffolding set up
- Added `COLLAB.md` (protocol) and this `HANDOFF.md`.
- No code in `phase1_cdr/` touched. Baseline is commit `0021c27` on `main`.
- **Next:** Codex to review `phase1_cdr/` (run tests + `validate.py`, scrutinize
  `detection.py`, and independently sanity-check `ground_truth.json` — do NOT just
  trust it, since it may have been reverse-engineered from the code). Report
  findings here grouped as Bugs / Test gaps / Correctness concerns / Nits, with
  file:line. Do not fix — leave fixes for Claude.
